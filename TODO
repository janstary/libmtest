geom[fld]: How does the sum of (1.2)^n converge?

ceil(), floor()

Uniformize the input-output interface.
Informaly, we want to pass a function,
which takes some numbr of args of certain types,
and oututs a certain type. As of now, we have
a header file for each test, and only do unary.

The build fo all test can be made uniform in the Makefile
